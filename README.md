A boot.dev project focuse on a simple video game, based on the classic Asteroids.

The learning goals of this project are:
  - Introduce you to multi-file Python projects
  - Show you a real-world use case for object-oriented programming
  - To have a ton of fun building a rewarding project!

The goal is not to teach game development or the math required for physics simulations. As a result, there are some places where you will simply copy-paste code that we wrote for you. 
Don't worry about trying to understand every detail if it's not interesting to you, you will be asked to write the parts that matter most.
